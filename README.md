# Collector-Swordsman
Collector Swordsman is a little action-platformer game made with **LÖVE2D**.  
This is first finished project of two newbie programmer. We did this game as our final project for **CS50x**.  
In Collector Swordsman, there are 3 levels where you need to kill all goblins and collect all coins to move to the next level.

## Tutorial
### Controls
- Move with W, A, S, D (You can also use arrow keys but since you have to use X to attack, it will be diffucult)
- Attack with X
- Jump with Space
- Mouse is not active in game

### Tips
- Try to get the best from double jump by pressing space again when you are at the highest point of your jump.
- Combat's core is about using range advantage against goblins. Try to attack when you are able to reach them but they are not.
- Attacking once, running back and attacking again or attacking once, jumping above the goblin and attacking again are the useful tactics.

We used class system thanks to Classic library to maintain organized and clean code. Each class file contains codes for particular part of the game.

## Known Problems
- Sometimes game crashes if space is spammed against a goblin.
- Jump amount may vary according to your system's FPS.  
We would like know if you find new bug or problem. Also, hearing some ideas and critics about or game would be great.
